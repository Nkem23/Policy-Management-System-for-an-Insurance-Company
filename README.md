## Policy-Management-System-for-an-Insurance-Company
This project is a simple insurance system built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python.  

It contains three main classes:
- **Product** → Represents insurance products (e.g., Health, Life, Auto).
- **PolicyHolder** → Represents customers/policyholders.
- **Payment** → Manages payments made by policyholders for their products.

The project also includes a `main.py` file that demonstrates how these classes work together.

## What’s Inside the Project

product.py – Contains the Product class to create, update, and manage insurance products.

policyholder.py – Contains the PolicyHolder class to register customers, assign products, and manage their accounts.

payment.py – Contains the Payment class to record and process payments linked to policyholders.

Main.py – A demonstration script showing how all the classes interact together.
